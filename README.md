<Strong>Foodents is an online cookbook tailored for students, implemented using HTML, CSS, PHP and SQL. The easiest and safest way to savour delicious food during these unfortunate times!</font></Strong>

### Our Inspiration
We are first-year students in the [`Department of Computer Science` ](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk)at [`The Univesity of Manchester`](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/). We come from different countries and cultures, but what brought us together was our common inability to keep up with a good meal schedule during term time. Not to mention the fact that we had to frequently self-isolate which left us with very limited ingredients in our kitchen. We decided to build a solution that would help not only just us, but also other students like us.
